## Project Overview

The "I Heart Tech" event aims to inspire and educate the next generation of technologists. My contribution, "Lights, Camera, Data!", provided a hands-on introduction to data analysis. Participants learned how to explore datasets, create meaningful visualizations, and build interactive dashboards to uncover insights from IMDb movie data.

## Presentation Focus

The presentation covered fundamental concepts in data analysis, including:

* **Data Exploration:** Understanding the structure and content of a dataset.
* **Data Visualization:** Techniques for representing data visually to identify patterns and trends.
* **Dashboard Creation:** Building interactive interfaces to present multiple visualizations and allow for dynamic exploration.
* **Insights Generation:** Drawing conclusions and telling stories from data.

## Contents of this Repository

This repository includes all the resources used and referenced during the "Lights, Camera, Data!" session:

* **`I Heart Tech Event Notes.txt`**: This file contains preparation and explanation notes for the presentation.
* **`I Heart Tech IMDb Data Analysis Resources.docx`**: A document listing additional resources, tools, and links for further learning in data analysis. This was shared with the class.
* **`imdb_movies.xlsx`**: The raw IMDb movie dataset in Excel format. This is an export of the table we prepared and cleansed in our database.
* **`IMDb Analysis - Excel Data Source.twb`**: The Tableau Workbook file containing the visualizations and dashboard created during and for the presentation. The version of this workbook points to the Excel data source instead of our database table to avoid the need for database access for the general public.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of this repository are:

* **Educational Resource:** To provide students and educators with access to the materials used in the "Lights, Camera, Data!" session for review and continued learning.
* **Demonstration:** To showcase a practical application of data analysis and visualization principles.
* **Inspiration:** To encourage high schoolers to explore careers in data science and technology.
